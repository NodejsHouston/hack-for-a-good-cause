# Intro To Software development

Software is a giant world that spans every conceivable field. This is a very brief and obnoxiously superficial look at the discipline.

## What is software

> The term "software" was first proposed by Alan Turing and used in this sense by John W. Tukey in 1957. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data.
> Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

Software is basically written instructions that tells a computer to do our bidding. /queue muahaha

_Algorithm_ - A set of self-contained step-by-step operations that when completed perform a specific calulcation or task.

## High vs. Low Level Code

General terms to describe how _close to the metal_ a given language is.

Pyramids of abstraction

Some random list found online I mostly agree with.

- Very low-level: Machine Code
- Low level: Assembler, Forth
- Mid level: C, C++, most system programming languages
- Mid/High level: D, Go, garbage collected system programming languages
- High level: Java, C#, most interpreted languages
- Even Higher level: Lisp dialects
- Highest level: SQL, declarative programming languages

These sorts of things are debatable and mostly a matter of opinion... So what's the point? It doesn't matter, programming languages are tools in your belt to solve problems - understand what _sort_ of problems they are good for and get cracking.

## The absurdly brief history of Computers & Software

- [Abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus): 2700-2300 BCE
- [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism): 100-200 BCE
- [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz): 1702
- [Jacquard's Loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Marie_Jacquard): 1801
- [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine): 1837
- [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing): 1936
- [Z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)): 1941
- [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix): 1969
- Insert joke about how it's all downhill from here
- [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/) :1989

## The Web

> In those days, there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer. Often it was just easier to go and ask people when they were having coffee...

The web isn't necessarily the collection of computers connected together via the Internet; but rather the collection technologies which allow these various (and different computers) to share information with each other.

> Tim’s initial proposal was not immediately accepted. In fact, his boss at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words “Vague but exciting” on the cover.

### HTML

HyperText Markup Language. The markup language for the Web. More on that later..

### URI

Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of "Address" that is unique and used to identify each resource on the Web. Commonly called a URL.

### HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources across the Web.

### Fundamental Principles

- Decentralisation: No permission is needed from a central authority to post anything on the Web, there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure … and no “kill switch”! This also implies freedom from indiscriminate censorship and surveillance.
- Non-discrimination: If I pay to connect to the internet with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or a greater quality of service, then we can both communicate at the same level. This principle of equity is also known as Net Neutrality.
- Bottom-up design: Instead of code being written and controlled by a small group of experts, it was developed in full view of everyone, encouraging maximum participation and experimentation.
- Universality: For anyone to be able to publish anything on the Web, all the computers involved have to speak the same languages to each other, no matter what different hardware people are using; where they live; or what cultural and political beliefs they have. In this way, the Web breaks down silos while still allowing diversity to flourish.
- Consensus: For universal standards to work, everyone had to agree to use them. Tim and others achieved this consensus by giving everyone a say in creating the standards, through a transparent, participatory process at W3C.

### Browsers

Application for the Operating System to retrieve, present & traverse resources.

### W3C

World Wide Web Consortium formed September 1994 at MIT with DARPA & EC. They create and maintain the standards which define the specifications of web technologies.
