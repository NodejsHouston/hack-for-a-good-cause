# JS WAT

## Want to be more confused?

* things that are not what they seem (arguments is not an array)
* `this` context: the same function call could have different `this` values
* Functional scope vs block scope
* ES6: const is a const variable (pointer), not a const object
* typeof may not return what you expect: `typeof [] === 'object'` not Array!
