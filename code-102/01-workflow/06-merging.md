# Git

## Hmm, there's a few extra screws...

* Bring your fork and/or branch up to date with upstream master
    * Some projects will use `git rebase` and resolve any merge issues
    * Some may just use merge and resolve any merge issues
* Make sure your style matches the style of the codebase and it passes style checks if they have one
* Make sure your code lints correctly if the project uses a linter
* Make sure you did not cause a test case to fail
* Help write tests for your new stuff to keep things at 100%
