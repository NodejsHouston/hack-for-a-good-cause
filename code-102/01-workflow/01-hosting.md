# Git

## Where can I host a project?

* Github
    * free for public projects
    * don't worry, can still control who has write access
    * top quality web interface
    * really good Markdown support
    * repos come with Wiki, issues
    * cost per month for private repos

* Bitbucket
    * free for both public and private repos
    * can organize multiple repos under a single project
    * not as good web interface as Github, but still really good
    * pretty decent Markdown support, but not 100% compatible with Github Flavored Markdown
    * repos come with Wiki, issues
    * costs for teams larger than 5 users (Someone with read or write access to one of your private repositories)
