# Git

## Contributing to another repo

The rest mostly deals with the standard flow on Github projects.

* Read the CONTRIBUTORS.md
    * Some repos follow very specific flows (Git Flow, Github Flow)
        * probably Github Flow if none specified, never hurts to ask!
    * Some repos have very specific rules for commits, branches, names
    * Some repos require agreeing to their terms before accepting code
    * Many repos will require some sort of linting, style checks, or test cases
